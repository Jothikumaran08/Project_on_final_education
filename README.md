# Project_on_final_education
This project focuses on analyzing educational data to identify trends, insights, and key factors affecting student performance. The dataset explores demographic details, academic performance, and social influences to provide actionable insights for improving educational outcomes.


Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key features:

StudentID: Unique identifier for each student.

Gender: Gender of the student.

Age: Age of the student.

Parental Education: Parent's highest education level.

Study Time: Weekly hours dedicated to studying.

Past Failures: Number of past academic failures.

Extra Activities: Participation in extracurricular activities.

Final Grade: Overall performance grade.

Data Cleaning Explanation

To ensure data quality, the following steps were performed:

Missing values were identified and imputed with appropriate techniques (mean/mode).

Outlier detection was applied to features like Study Time and Final Grade.

Encoding techniques were used to convert categorical data into numerical format for easier model training.

Key Analysis Performed

Correlation analysis between study time, parental education, and final grades.

Distribution analysis of students by age and gender.

Identification of key factors influencing student performance.

Visualizations for Key Insights
